# Explainable-AI-for-Sentiment-Analysis# Explainable AI for Sentiment Analysis

## 📌 Overview
This project explores sentiment analysis using machine learning and explainable AI (XAI) techniques to better understand how models make predictions on text data. The focus is not only on predicting sentiment, but also on interpreting and explaining model behavior in a transparent and human-understandable way.

The project demonstrates applied machine learning, text preprocessing, and explainability concepts using a notebook-based workflow.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Perform sentiment analysis on text data using machine learning models
- Analyze how different input features influence model predictions
- Apply explainable AI techniques to interpret model decisions
- Improve trust and transparency in sentiment classification models

## 🧠 Approach
- Preprocessed text data for sentiment analysis
- Built and evaluated machine learning models for sentiment classification
- Applied explainable AI methods to understand feature contributions
- Analyzed explanations to interpret why the model predicts certain sentiments
